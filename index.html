                    Every year, the commercial bail industry underwrites billions of dollars in bonds promising to return criminal defendants to court, often securing those bonds with liens on real property. Relying on public real estate data, Cities of Bail visualizes the practice of mortgaging property to secure bail in six U.S. counties. Click below or on the map to explore the impact of bail bonding on urban communities and the connections between bail markets and marginalized populations.

                    The six selected cities represent diverse American regions and social conditions. Albuquerque and Jersey City stand out for being in states that enacted significant bail reforms within the past five years. In 2016, New Mexico voters approved a constitutional amendment that prohibits pretrial detention solely because an arrestee is unable to post bail. In 2017, New Jerseyâ€™s Criminal Justice Reform Act largely eliminated money bail and established a presumption of release for most defendants unless deemed dangerous under strict standards. By examining these areas before and after reform, this project will highlight the community impact of bail reform and offer insights to support a fairer pretrial justice system.
