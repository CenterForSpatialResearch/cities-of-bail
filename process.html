        When someone is arrested and charged with a crime, federal law requires that they be taken "promptly"—usually within 48 hours—to a magistrate who will decide their conditions for release pending trial.<sup><a href="#note1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Conditions of release always include the promise to appear at trial and other important hearings, but they can include many other things as well, such as curfews, check-ins, drug testing, or dispossession of firearms.<sup><a href="#note2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The most common condition of release in the United States today is the payment of a set amount of money, known as a bail bond. If the defendant appears at all scheduled hearings, the bail money is refunded. If not, the money is forfeited to the state or county who filed the charges.<sup><a href="#note3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

        It is commonly reported that the median bail amount set for a felony charge is $10,000,<sup><a href="#note4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> but depending on the charges and the jurisdiction, bail amounts can be much, much higher. Many judges rely on a bail schedule—a chart of predetermined bail amounts corresponding to particular charges—to quickly assess bail for individual defendants.<sup><a href="#note5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> New Jersey uses a <a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/administrative-directives/2007/10/dir_09_05_supp2.pdf">uniform schedule</a> across the state, which includes entries like this:
