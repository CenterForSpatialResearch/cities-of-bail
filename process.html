             When someone is arrested and charged with a crime, federal law requires that they be taken “promptly”&mdash;usually within 48 hours&mdash;to a magistrate who will decide their conditions for release pending trial.  Conditions of release always include the promise to appear at trial and other important hearings, but they can include many other things as well, such as curfews, check-ins, drug testing, or dispossession of firearms.  The most common condition of release in the United States today is the payment of a set amount of money, known as a bail bond. If the defendant appears at all scheduled hearings, the bail money is refunded. If not, the money is forfeited to the state or county who filed the charges.

            It is commonly reported that the median bail amount set for a felony charge is $10,000,  but depending on the charges and the jurisdiction, bail amounts can be much, much higher. Many judges rely on a bail schedule---a chart of predetermined bail amounts corresponding to particular charges---to quickly assess bail for individual defendants.  New Jersey uses a <a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/administrative-directives/2007/10/dir_09_05_supp2.pdf">uniform schedule</a> across the state, which includes entries like this:
